## Processing Steps
Block-level population data from the 2020 P.L. census data release was gathered for every state and then aggregated to the 119th Congressional Districts using a block-assignment file. 

2022 ACS household income was originally available at the block-group level and consists of counts of households in the following income ranges: <10k, 10-15k, 20-25k, 25k-30k, 30-35k, 35-40k, 40-45k, 45-50k, 50-60k, 60-75k, 75-100k, 100-125k, 125-150k, 150k-200k and 200k+. This data was disaggregated from the block group level to the block-level based one each block's share of the total number of occupied housing units within the block group, resulting in an estimate of household counts in each of the ranges of incomes in each block. These counts are then aggregated up to the district-level using a block-assignment file. An estimated median income value was also calculated, based on the counts of households in each category is present above. For example, if a district had 2.2 households between 20-25k, 1 household between 35-40k and 2.5 households between 60k-70k, the median would be 35-40k. Ties go to the lower range. All values are in 2022 inflation-adjusted dollars.

â€‹Language and foreign born population data was first disaggregated from the tract level to the block-level using total population at the block, and education was disaggregated from the block-group level to the block level using 25+ population. For all ACS data disaggregations, if there were any cases were there was data at the block group / tract in the data to disaggregate but not in the PL data with which I was creating a ratio, values were disaggregated proportionally across the relevant geography.

Election results data was initially retrieved from Voting Election Science Team (VEST) and disaggregated to the block-level using each block's population of non-incarcerated voting-age population. This data was joined to a block-assignment file and aggregated to the district-level.

Lastly, data was all aggregated to the 119th Congressional Districts using a block-assignment file.

Any blocks that are not assigned to a district have 0 total population and are filtered out of the final file.

Please note that some states used adjusted population data when drawing their congressional districts (https://redistrictingdatahub.org/reports/states-that-adjust-the-census-data-for-redistricting/), the data in this file is unadjusted, and as such, district-population deviations based on total population may be incorrect.
